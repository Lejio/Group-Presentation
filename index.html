						Did you know that only current freshmen would get to utilize the purple line?
						Yes that's right, the purple line that is currently splitting campus in half won't be in service until 2027.

						There is a massive construction issue on campus. As University of Maryland students ourselves, we've all

					<aside class="notes">
						Given the major construction projects taking place on the University of Maryland campus, there should be
						an effort made to reduce the disruption. Whether it is to splitting up a construction project, creating a
						construction free walkway, or notifying students of construction delays, something must be done.

							There is a lower initial investment as the project is split up into smaller, more affordable pieces. (Merrill, 2020)
							Problems that occur during the first few phases can be worked out before continuing on to other phases, allowing time and planning to make changes. (Merrill, 2020)

						<aside class="notes">
							- University of Minnesota utilizes phased construction to allow parts of buildings to be completely functional while other parts are under construction, which minimizes displacement and disruption to a studentâ€™s day. (Procedures for phased construction projects: UMN University Health & Safety)
							- There is a lower initial investment cost, and you don't have to pay for the whole project at once, making it easier to budget. Breaking the project up into small pieces results in breaking the overall cost up into small pieces, making it more manageable than paying for the whole project all at once. (Beran, 2021)

							If one phase does not finish on schedule, it causes a domino effect resulting in every following phase being delayed and the overall project taking much longer and becoming more complex.
